# Rails Invader

Invade a database installation! Interrogate it! Emit the things!

This utility will interrogate an existing database and emit model classes.

Handy for getting a rails console up quickly in an existing database. Nothing much beats ActiveRecord & rails / pry console for quick exploration.



## TODO

* Generate a rails project and insert the models
* Ability to set the class template file
* Ability to visit table's and column's and emit code if needed
* Drop into a irb/pry console without creating model classes directly
